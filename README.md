# Work Spots
For many people, working in a consistent space for consistent tasks helps focus their work (e.g. exclusively working on writing in a home office, but working on finances in a local cafe). However, it may also be beneficial to periodically change locations to refresh one's headspace. Based on this notion, this program pseudo-randomly pairs responsibilities with locations, and the pairings reshuffle periodically. Personal responsibilities and locations must be entered manually, but they will be stored locally for reuse the next time the program is run.

## Version History
### Version 1 - Current
This version is a command-line based program. The option menu is as shown:
>1) Add responsibilities
>2) Add work spots
>3) View your responsibilities and work spots
>4) Pair responsibilities and work spots
>5) Quit

The pairings reshuffle every two weeks. Responsibilities and work spots are stored locally in txt files titled "responsibilities.txt" and "workspots.txt", respectively.
